==============================================================

1) Automation example. Power to the company, and less money for the workers. Outsourced by the companies.
Stress for the people. we are lossing culture because of the jobs are getting lessers.

2) Stress is everywhere, whenever and whereever you are. All places possible. ANd lack of trust demoralized to work.
Stress can manifest at anytime. Forced to eat unhealthy foods like no food and short lunch such as fastfoods.
Changes the culture of working. Temporary space to work although they are full time workers.


3) Job Spill what are ways:
Examples would be:
1. Checking email at h
Teome
2. Pagers
3. Taking work calls on the way home.
4. Texing work on the way home.
5. Doing work (getting ahead) outside of the workplace
Technology is almost interlaced with our lives, causes sleep deprivation, axieity, stress, burn-outs.
Relates to the marketplace, the marketplace requires people to work harder for more "efficiency"



4) Consuming vs Working. The more we commidify the more we become estranged. e.g. Mexico made these factories
workers in slums that factories (you wont know what inside them). Mostly women in low wage in those facctories
and a lot of violence.

5. Working at a restaurant.
