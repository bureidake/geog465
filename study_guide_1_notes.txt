 1. For social geographers, place matters. Use one example to explain how and why place matters. 
In geography, Geographers refer “location” in to two categories, absolute and relative. “place matters” refers to relative location.

An understanding of the socially constructed nature of space & place;  that most differences between people  are not the results of inherent characteristics.  Note: Space tends to be more abstract than place; place can be understood as space that has specific meaning. 

For SGers, Social Behavior and Social Relations are Spatial

““I study how
spaces are organized for the purposes of health and health care” or “ I am interested
in how people experience different places differently.” As is the case in many other
places, people were perplexed by my interest in geography and HIV/AIDS. What
could a geographer possibly be studying about AIDS? “Are you mapping AIDS?”
someone might ask. Over time, as my Thai language skills got better, I nuanced my
response to these questions; I began to identify not as a geographer (nakphumisat)
but as a social geographer (nakphumisat thang sangkhom). This qualification seemed
to work, as people began to identify me as someone who was interested in social
issues related to the practices of social institutions, such as the health care and
educational sectors, governmental and political organizations, and nongovernmental
and community-based networks and associations. At the time, I didn’t think much
of this switch. To be honest, like most of my colleagues in graduate school, I wasn’t
a big fan of subdsicplinary labels. But, upon reflection, I see this qualification, as
someone who is a social geographer and not just a geographer, as an important one.
It is important because it signals that my interests lie in questions related to the
social, to the dynamic geographies of difference and inequality that are central to
the everyday lives of so many people, not the least of whom were people at the
center of my research, those living with HIV and AIDS in northern Thailand.”

2. According to the film “Commanding Heights,” who are the principal actors (theorists & politicians),
 and what are the major ideological, political, ideological, and economic strategy shifts between 1920 
 and 2000?

The economic prosperity of the 1920s was caused by a couple of major factors. First of all, more people 
were buying American goods, so booming manufacturing in the country. This was partially due to tariffs 
on European goods that made foreign import less profitable. In fact the manufacturing output increase by 
more than 60 percent. The other big factor leading to economic prosperity was technology. Advancement in 
the automobile industry, for example, lead to the prosperity of many more industries, such as the road 
construction, the oil and the steel industries. Then, improved innovations, like the radio, also contributed
 to economic prosperity through the new market items that it created. Improvements in travel technology 
 contributed to efficiency and profit as well. Growing industrial consolidation is also an example of the 
 economic prosperity in that it was the result of efforts to keep competition under control. All the
  economic well being, then increased standards of living in America and the prosperity of the stock market.

Some of the problems that were hidden by this economic prosperity include the remaining inequalities and 
injustices in the society. Even though the living standards had increased for most workers, over two-thirds
 of the people remained in undesired living conditions. In general, workers wages did not even go up close 
 to the improved standards of the economy as a whole. Labor unions were less effective as well, since they
  had to adapt to the new economy first and this proved very bad for workers who now were facing strong 
  cooperations. Despite being an important part of the work force, labor organizations did not even consider
 creating labor unions for women or African Americans.

3. What is Polanyi’s critique of neoliberalism? What does Polanyi mean, “Our thesis is that the idea of a self-adjusting market implied a stark utopia…?”
