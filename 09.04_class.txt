Social Market vs Free Market
-Polanyi argues general types of economic systems:
1. redistributes
2. reciprocity
3. householding
.. social markets are regulated, "give person a ride and that person of favor should like you back"
.. "The passing of marketi economy can become// era of unprecented freedom.. regulation and control can acheive freedom not only for few, but for all"
.. e.g. wealthy ppl have more choice than ppl who dont have money

-Rise of Nation-State in which proces of all goods, labor, changed without regards to effects on society; sefl regulation..

Polanyi's Basic Ideas
-Embeddedness: The economy is naturally embedness to instutions (political, religious) amd social relations especially trust (buyers beware) markets limited by instutions
-Fictious commodities
-Self-Regulation Market society
-Politics
-The Double Movement: embedness vs non Embeddedness of government

the Double Movement
Change:
1. Movement
2. Countermovement:  Forces to protect societies from the negative externalitities of free markets (market forces); subordinationing the economy to society
3. Interaction
4. Politics amd Class Conflict
5. Stability: Double movement is neccessary
.. Strong movement
..stale market
.. Strong Countermovement -> self regulating subodinated to democratic instutions (e.g. scandinavia)
.. regulate by morals like no human trafficking

----
Movement
-Goal: Establishing the Self-Regulating market (dis-embed market forces from social institions ) towards marketizations, the spread of market thing, market-based
forms of allocation.

-Forces/Proponents (today)
..neoliberals: sectors of big business, finance, expport-based forms, and political allies. A planned attempt using the state to impose the self-regulating market on society; creating a "free market" from social institions through deregulation, privatizatio
n
-Principles :.. lassez faire...(government intervention emphasis)


----

..
..
..
..

----

-Forces/Proponents: a reaction driven by those most affected by the expanding markets or the commodification of everything

Polanyi's Agrument: self-regulating economic systems is a myth (Utopia)
- Free market economy - in which markets are entirely freee from social or political control - is a myth, during the era of laissez faire- created by state coercion and depends on power of governments to work

-Role of government and politics: "all of the key inputs int economy-land, labor, and money- are social contructions and sustained through government's coercive power"(BLock, p.xxvi)
.."financial orgs insits should be free of regulations.."


Regulations/Rules:
Always neccassary to create markets: What kinds of regualations should implemented not regulations vs deregulation
...
...

-----
SUMMARY:
-Polanyi rejects the idea of state should (economic Liberalism) or Marxists could wither away
-laissez-faire not a method to acheive a thing, it was the thing to be achieved
-There is nothing nature about laissezfaire, disembedded economies
-laissezfaire was planned, planning was not
-"Our thesis is that idea of self adjusting market implied a stark utopia.."
-Labor, Land, Money.. are fictious commodities they were not orginally produced and sold on a market... Labor is activity of human beings (social neoliberalism...
...
)

------
The Central Paradox of our time
-economic (neoliberal) globalization does not strengten the current regime of global laissez-faire but works to undermind it.
-and inevitabity creates a political Countermovement.

-"The expansion of market forces.."
